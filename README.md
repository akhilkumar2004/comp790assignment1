I have created an arcade-styled target game that allows the user to tap on the target several times to see how many points they can score in under 5 seconds. Once the game is launched, the user has to tap on the screen immediately before the 
timer runs out. Initially, I made a script where the only constraint was to have the user have only have only 10 balls to throw to the target, however to make this interesting, I made a time constraint where the user would have 5 seconds to
score however many points just by tapping on the target. Some scripts I created were the ball collision, where if the ball hits the target, the score would add up one point, and a timer where the clock would start ticking 5 seconds after the 
game launches. This would be an example of a game because the qualities that this game includes, according to the readings, are that games can be interactive and have a challenge. This game is interactive on iPhones as the user can touch the 
screen to see the ball launch towards the tower in a rapid motion, and the challenge is that the user would have to do this in a 5-second limit.
